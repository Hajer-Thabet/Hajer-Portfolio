        <h3 class="center">Hi, I'm Hajer</h3>
        <p>Presently, I have been residing in New York, having to set aside my love and experience in software engineering to familiarize myself with the necessary financial, cultural, and professional knowledge needed when moving to a new country. The support from my family to continue to pursue my love of computer science has fueled my confidence in furthering my education here in the States, particularly with <a href= "https://www.thinkful.com/ ">Thinkful</a>.</p> 
        I have many interests and hobbies outside of work:
        
          <ul>
             <li>Travel with my friends every chance I get</li>
             <li>Volunteering, community service or charity work</li>
             <li>Sports such as competing on a team or in a league, swimming or hiking</li>
          </ul>

        <h3 class="center">About Me</h3> 

      I have a master's degree in Electronics and Digital Technology. I’ve learned a lot of languages since I graduated from college. In school, I had to focus on C++, Javascript, SQL, HTML, and MATLAB. Outside of class, I spent time experimenting with newer languages like Java and Python. Since graduating, I’ve worked on some projects and Certificates that require those languages:
        
          <ul>
             <li>Building AI Applications with Watson API’s</li>
             <li>Deploy Models with TensorFlow Serving and Flask </li>
             <li>Facial Expression Recognition with Keras</li>
             <li>Neural Network Visualizer Web App with Python</li>
             <li>Machine Learning with Python Certificate</li>
             <li>AWS Elastic Beanstalk Deploy a Python (Flask) Web Application Certificate</li>
          </ul>
       

       <p> I strive to work with a diverse group of people and I would like to work for a company that has an environment that encourages excellence, creativity and diversity. </p>
